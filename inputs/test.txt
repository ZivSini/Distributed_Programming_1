Some people thought little Billy Epstein and I were gay, but we really took Home Ec class because that was where all the chicks were.  We learned a lot in that class - about life, our sexuality, pubescent females and food prep.  Our teacher, Ed Banapeel, was very competitive.  We sliced and we diced into all hours of the night practicing and hoping that we could all get full-ride scholarships to culinary schools.  Banapeel was certain that would elevate his program higher than the football and basketball programs combined.  He needed to find a competitive edge and one day found it on Amazon - the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer.  It was faster than anything we had seen before, and clean-up was a breeze.  However, the Hutzler 571 is so much more.Being adolescent males, we decided to sneak a Hutzler 571 out of the school to spend more time with it and realize its full potential.  We found ourselves in the Home Ec room at the precise moment when Banapeel's morning coffee kicked in and he made a beeline to the bathroom to lighten his load.  Little Billy grabbed the Hutzler 571 and jammed it down his pants in a flash.  We tried to make our way to the doorway without anybody noticing us, but little Billy caught the attention of every girl in the class (if you know what I mean).  As soon as we hit the hallway, we were off and running.  We knew we would get in trouble for skipping school, but we didn't care.  We had the Hutzler 571 and it was ours.  We made it all the way to little Billy's house.  We knew we were safe there because his parents both worked during the day.  His Mom was a Slinky tester and his Dad licked envelopes for the Publishers Clearinghouse Sweepstakes.  In all the excitement after we arrived at his house, little Billy pulled the Hutzler 571 out of his pants a little too quickly.  He is now a Eunuch.But our story doesn't end there.  We buried the Hutzler 571 in little Billy's backyard to avoid suspicion.  However, we had to keep burying it because several dogs and a raccoon kept digging it back up with all of the blood on it.  After little Billy had finally healed, we decided to see what the Hutzler 571 could do.  After all, we never got that chance before due to little Billy's misfortune.  As little Billy was lifting it from the ground, the dogs were all over it, so I grabbed it and threw it like a boomerang.  With amazing accuracy it went out about 100 yards and made a perfect turn and trajectory right back to my hand.  I didn't have to move.  It was just there.  Little Billy was awestruck.  He tried to do the same thing, but failed miserably (like most paper airplanes he made in his lifetime).  Not wanting him to feel bad, I told him that maybe we could play catch with it and use it like a frisbee instead of a boomerang.  Poor little Billy lost 2 fingers that day.  He was a good sport about it, but never picked up another Hutzler 571.So, I finally had the Hutzler 571 all to myself.  I took it out and continued using it like a boomerang and found my accuracy improving exponentially.  I started taking out pigeons in mid-flight and progressed to bats at dusk.  I was getting the attention of everyone on the neighborhood and crowds started forming to watch me use my new honed skills.  The crowds grew and grew even larger.  At first I was surprised to see the college scouts, but I was more impressed to learn that Hutzler was after me to found it's very own Hutzler 571 Boomerang League.  It was when the Secret Service showed up that I started to get scared.  I was afraid that old Banapeel was finally on to me and had figured out I had pinched the Hutzler 571.  That wasn't it at all.  They wanted me to go skeet shooting with Barack Obama.  Don't tell the POTUS, but he never hit a clay pigeon to save his life.  It was really me and my Hutzler 571 hiding off in the woods.","rating":5,"author":"WAM","date":"2013-04-06T21:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"R2PWV5GNRKFKLI","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2PWV5GNRKFKLI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII","title":"Great Gag Gift","text":"Lots of fun with this as a gift, lots of laughing about it.

Plantain, a sole banana slicer was forged. Inscribed in the edge was the text \"Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer. One slicer to rule them all. One banana to find them. One perfect wedge to bring them all, and without a knife slice them.\" The power was too much for mere mortals, and though they had innocent intentions, the power of perfect banana slices overcame them. One by one the mortals fell, and so it was determined: For the sake of mankind, the One Slicer had to be destroyed.It was quite by fate--and the will of a pothead--that I came across this product on Amazon. The reviews were good, so I bought it, but little did I know that soon my soul would be consumed by the ancient weapon of darkness. I eagerly awaited its arrival, contemplating the immense ease and efficiency with which I would soon be able to slice my bananas.Later that week, as I was practicing my turkey call, I suddenly heard a knock at the door. I leaped to my feet, anticipating the arrival of my beautiful banana slicer. I threw open the door, only to be greeted by a man in a gray robe. \"Do you have any spare towels?\" He inquired, \"This is my roommate's bathrobe and I already used the curtains last week.\" He forced his way in and made himself comfortable.He was a peculiar man who stood nearly seven feet tall and smelled of sweet cannabis. Shocked by his uninvited entrance, I stood there dumbly until another knock at the door shook me out of my stupor.It was the UPS man; he had come to deliver my precious banana slicer. I was about to sign for the package, when suddenly, my uninvited house guest pushed me aside and shouted with all his might, \"YOU SHALL NOT PASS!\".The UPS man looked absolutely horrified. Right as I was about to apologize, the man in robes pushed his way out of the door and took off down the street. \"That may be the strangest thing that has happened this week!\" I remarked. After asking me to sign for the package, the UPS man asked me for my autograph to give to his daughter, who was a huge fan of my turkey calling skills.Rushing inside as soon as I could, I stared at the package which I knew contained everything my heart desired. I clawed at the package, desperately trying to free the precious slicer--MY precious slicer--But the power that bound this box could not be undone. As I was clamoring for a method to unleash the power of my very own banana slicer, I was once again interrupted by the man in the robes.\"Don't open it!\" he shouted, as he barged through the door. \"The power that is contained in that box will unleash a barrage of evil that will consume all of mankind!\" Immediately after uttering these words, he collapsed on the carpet and did not come to for three days.When he regained consciousness, and the substance that clouded his mind had dissipated, he blurted out, \"Is it secret? Is it safe?\" Soon after, he proceeded to inform me of the ancient legend of this very banana slicer.\"It consumed the souls of every mortal who has ever tried to wield its power\" he said. \"The simplicity and perfection of the slicer corrupted the hearts of even the most honorable men. The ease with which it slices was far too much for this world, and soon its dark power covered the world with darkness.\"\"What can be done?\" I asked. I could feel the slicer calling to me, so I knew it was legit.\"We must return it from whence it came,\" he replied. \"Through the chasm of the Brooklyn Bridge, across Manhattan to the center of Connecticut, where the fires of Mt. Plantain still burn; the only fire hot enough to consume the slicer once and for all. It will be a long a perilous journey, not for the faint of heart.\"\"The slicer is my burden.\" I said solemnly, as I realized the sealing of my fate. Thus, I embarked on a journey that would forever change the fate of the world.","rating":5,"author":"Froyo Swaggins","date":"2014-09-12T21:00:00.000Z"},{"id":"R1R1X0TN9OS7SH","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1R1X0TN9OS7SH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII","title":"One Star","text":"Too big of slices and not easy to clean.
